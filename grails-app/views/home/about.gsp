		<h1>About AugurWorks</h1>
		<p>
			In late 2012, Brian Conn and Stephen Freiberg, two MIT '13 graduates, joined forces with Drew Showers, to solve a difficult problem many have tried to solve before: 
			how to predict the stock market. Thus, AugurWorks was born.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Since then we've been integrating and analyzing various sources of data to help in predicting the market: historical stock price data and sentiment generated from 
			news stories and Twitter streams. We've also begun to analyze the data using tailored algorithms such as decision trees, linear regressions, and neural nets.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Early testing was very positive. However, we found that manual data integration is extremely time consuming, especially when our normal working sessions are frequent, short 
			sessions following our day job. To flatten these issues, we started this website to facilitate data visualization, integration, and analysis, which was released as 
			our Alpha product. Here users can get up to date on the market and generate stock predictions.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Since our November ’13 Alpha release, we’ve continued to integrate hundreds of new data sources to feed the algorithms. As a result, the new Beta release will provide 
			users with a few of these algorithms to make analysis much easier. We will continue to mature our Beta over the next few months with additional analysis automation, as 
			well as a new community service for users to collaborate, share ideas and investment results. Your feedback is critical to helping us build an easy to use, high value product.

			We found that manual data integration is extremely time consuming, especially when our normal working sessions are frequent, short sessions after work. To flatten these issues, we started this website as a side project to facilitate data visualization, integration, and analysis. Here users can get up to date on the market and generate stock predictions. We are developing in Grails, a modern Java based Model-View-Controller language, which allows us to create plugins for new algorithms and data services so we can maintain a flexible, evolving website allowing us to respond quickly to user requests. -->
